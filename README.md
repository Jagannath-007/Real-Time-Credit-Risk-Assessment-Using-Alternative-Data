# Real-Time Credit Risk Assessment Using Alternative Data

## Objective
Develop a system that assesses credit risk in real-time by analyzing traditional financial data and alternative data sources, such as social media, utility payments, and spending habits.

---

## Key Components

### 1. Develop a Data Pipeline
- **Objective**: Collect and integrate both traditional and alternative data sources in real-time.
- **Data Sources**:
  - **Traditional**: Credit scores, income statements, loan repayment history.
  - **Alternative**:
    - Social Media Sentiment: Analyze posts and activity to determine financial stability.
    - Geolocation Data: Use movement patterns to assess lifestyle and employment consistency.
    - Utility Payment Records: Incorporate timely payments for utilities, rent, or subscriptions.
- **Breakdown**:
  - Design and implement a robust data collection pipeline.
  - Centralize and clean data using a data lake or warehouse.
  - Generate relevant features from both traditional and alternative datasets.
  - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA.

### 2. Train a Machine Learning Model
- **Objective**: Predict loan default risk based on a mix of traditional and alternative data.
- **Approach**:
  - Preprocess data to handle missing values and normalize features.
  - Choose models from:
    - Ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
    - Neural networks for more complex, non-linear relationships.
  - Assess model performance using:
    - **Accuracy**: Reflect general model correctness.
    - **AUC-ROC**: Measure classification quality.
    - **Precision-Recall**: Handle imbalanced datasets.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A model capable of providing real-time credit risk assessments.

### 3. Ensure Explainability
- **Objective**: Make credit risk scores interpretable and understandable for lenders.
- **Methods**:
  - Use tools such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to justify model decisions.
  - Highlight attributes influencing creditworthiness.
  - Develop visualizations and reports to present results clearly.
- **Deliverables**:
  - An interface or dashboard displaying credit risk scores with insights into the decision-making process.

---

## Expected Outcomes
- A robust, real-time credit risk assessment system that bridges traditional and alternative data.
- Increased credit access for individuals with little to no credit history.
- Transparent and explainable credit risk scores to build trust among lenders.
